# Week 6 -- Network Layer Part 1

Network Layer protocols are in every host and router (except for switches). Routers examine header files in all IP diagrams passing through it.



**Routing and forwarding**

- Forwarding: Move packets from the router's input to appropriate router output.

- Routing: Determine route taken by packets from source to destination. Implemented by routing algorithms.



## Datagram forwarding table

There are over 4 billion IP addresses, therefore, rather than listing all IP addresses and determine the output interface, the router lists a range of addresses. This is called a *datagram forwarding table*. The table is  constructed by the control plane (routing process) and carried out by data plane (forwarding process).
