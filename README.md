# Programming Language Learning
## Introduction
I learn programming languages in the following steps:
1. Find a recommended book by friends/professors/on the internet,
2. Read a section and highlight the important content,
3. Copy the code in that section and run it, debug if necessary,
4. Take notes for the highlighted parts.

In step 4, I used to take notes with a stationary. Now I feel it more convenient to use markdown to edit the notes, which may also benefit the others who have similar habit of taking notes.

However, I use the notes mainly for my own revision purpose. So I will not do redundant job of copying the previous notes 
I've taken on stationary. Also, as the book may or may not be in English, the language of the note will be aligned with 
the the language of the book. I will try to read as much English as possible, but don't be surprised if the note is pure 
Chinese.

I am only an undergraduate student. I would appreciate it if any viewer could submit an issue whenever finding any mistakes 
or typos.

## [C++](CPP/)
The reference book is [C++ Primer Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-6th-Developers-Library/dp/0321776402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529391063&sr=8-1&keywords=C%2B%2B+primer+plus)
, I read the Chinese version [C++ Primer Plus](https://book.douban.com/subject/10789789/).
This book covers from the basic syntax to OOP rules, with a little introduction to STL.

## [Python](Python/)
The reference book is [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036), 
I read the Chinese version [Python编程：从入门到实践](https://book.douban.com/subject/26829016/).
This book talks about python in a project-based way. Very practical.
