# Learning Notes

I take notes when studying, for boosting thoughts instead of giving myself the illusion that I have learnt lots of things. I do not usually keep them as they can be found easily in books and on web. However, sometimes it's better to do some collection when I have to memorize a bunch of disorganized materials. Could be extremely helpful to write up the notes gain to fresh my memory.

I'd be glad if any of these notes are helpful to others. However, please note that NONE of the notes is self-contained. They may only serve as supportive explanations. All Markdown notes are taken using [Typora](https://typora.io/). I recommend that you use Typora to read those notes because GitHub do not render equations.



## Cityu Courses

Notes for courses I have taken or am taking in [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/). I update them as I take courses. Materials I use is mainly the lecture notes and readings provided by instructors.



## CPP

C++ notes. Taken from *C++ Primer Plus*. I read the Chinese version, typed the examples from the book and took some notes by hand. I will add more advanced notes (could be STL, OOP notes in C++) in the future if I still use C++:)



## Java

Java notes. Taken from *Core Java*. This book is hard to read as not many examples are given to explain the concepts.



## Python

Python notes. Taken from *python crash course a hands-on project-based introduction to programming*. This one is too messy to read. I consider removing it in the future or refactoring(?) it.



## CS231n

My additional notes and works on the assignments for Stanford [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). Course notes are available on course web.
