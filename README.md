# Learning Notes

Electronic notes I have taken when taking courses or doing projects. Use [Typora](https://typora.io/) to view the markdown notes as GitHub do not have built-in support for math rendering.

I personally do not recommend spending much time on taking extensive notes. However, it's often useful to put things together when the materials presented to you are a bit disorganized. This repository serves as a toolbox that helps recall the high level ideas of these materials in a systematic way.
